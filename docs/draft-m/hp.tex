\section{HP Causality}

\begin{thm}
Given an event structure $\es$, a cause $X = S \vdash\,e$
where $(S, e) \in \vdash$, and an effect $Y = S_f$
where $S_f \in \conf{\es}$, $X$ is a cause of $Y$
(according to the HP definition) if there is at least one path
from $m_{S,e}$ to $x_{S_f}$ in the causal graph of $\es$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We check the conditions of HP causality for the given cause and effect.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{AC1:} Both the cause and effect hold in the factual scenario;
  therefore, this condition is satisfied.
\end{itemize}

For AC2.\{a,b\}, assume $(W, w, x')$ is the witness discussed by HP.

\begin{itemize}  
  \item \textbf{AC2.a:} The idea here is to restrict the causal graph
  such that the effect holds as long as the cause.
  
  Assume the path from cause to effect is as follows:
  \[
    m_{S,e} \rightarrow
    r_{S_1,S_2} \rightarrow
    x_{S_2} \rightarrow
    r_{S_2, S_3} \rightarrow
    \cdots \rightarrow
    r_{S_{k-1}, S_k} \rightarrow x_{S_k} = x_{S_f}
  \]

  We also define $W$ as:
  \[ \left( \In{r_{S_1, S_2}} \setminus \set{x_{S_1}, m_{S,e}} \right) \cup
    \left( \bigcup_{i=2}^k \In{x_{S_i}} \setminus \set{r_{S_{i-1}, S_i}} \right) \]
   
  The elements of $W$ are shown with dotted boxes in Fig. \ref{fig:witness}.
  All variables in $W$ are set to False ($w$ is an all-False valuation).
  $x'$ sets $r_{S,e}$ to False as well.

  With the witness described above, we can see that the effect $x_{S_f}$
  is also valuated as False; therefore, condition AC2.a is satisfied.
  
  
  \item \textbf{AC2.b:} After setting $m_{S,e}$ to True,
  while maintaining $w$ as all-False, $x_{S_f}$ is valuated to True again.
  The \textit{validating} edges for $x_{S_f}$ are shown with thick lines
  in Fig. \ref{fig:ac2.b}. Observe that, re-setting any variable $v \not\in W$
  does \textbf{not} \textit{invalidate} the specified path for $X_{S_f}$.

  \item \textbf{AC3:} As our cause is a singleton,
  this condition is also satisfied.
\end{itemize}
