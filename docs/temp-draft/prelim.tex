\begin{prop}\label{prop:es-induction}
  For a given event structure $\es$, a set $X \in \conf{\es}$,
  and an event $e$, $X \cup \set{e} \in \conf{\es}$ iff
  \[ ( \forall e' \in X.\; e' \cancel{\#} e ) \wedge
    ( \exists S \subseteq X.\; S \minen e ) \]
\end{prop}

\begin{defn}
  Given sets $S, W$ of variables in a causal model
  ($S \cap W = \varnothing$), and vector $w$ of values for $W$,
  $S_w$ is the valuation of variables in $S$
  after fixing all values in $W$ to $w$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  Given disjoint sets $X,Y$ in a causal model, with respective values $x,y$,
  we have $x \propto y$ iff $X=x$ is a cause of $Y=y$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}\label{defn:W-projection}
  Let $M =(U,V,F)$ be a recursive causal model.
  Suppose we have a causal world $(M,u)$ such that $V = \set{V_1, \cdots, V_n}$.
  To delete a variable $V_i$ from $(M,u)$, $V_i$ is removed from $V$,
  and the structural equation $F_X$ of each child $X$ of $V_i$
  is replaced with $F_X |_{v_i}$ , where $v_i = V_i(u)$.
  The projection of $(M,u)$ over variables $V_1, V_2, \cdots, V_k$ is a new causal model
  % in which $V_{k+1},V_{k+2}, \cdots, V_n$ are deleted from $(M,u)$.
  The \textit{W-projection} of $(M,u)$ with respect to $x \propto y$
  is the projection of $(M, u)$ over $X$, $Y$, the variables $V^{XY}$
  on a path from $X$ to $Y$ in the causal network of $M$,
  and the parents of $V^{XY}$ and $Y$ in the causal network of $M$.
