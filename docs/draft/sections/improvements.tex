\section{Complexity Improvements for Causality}

\MK{Maybe we should say this when we define causality?}
Eiter and Lukasiewicz \cite{eiter2001complexity} have shown that, for
a given cause $X=x$ and effect $Y=y$, deciding whether $X=x$ is an
actual cause of $Y=y$ is $\Sigma_2^P$-complete. In this section, we 
present results that aim to reduce this complexity.

\subsection{Singleton Cause}

The following theorem is first presented by Halpern and Pearl as a 
conjecture, which is later proved by Eiter and Lukasiewicz in 
\cite{eiter2001complexity}:

\begin{theorem}\label{th:singleton-cause}
    Let $M=(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F})$ be a causal model, where 
    $\mathcal{S}=(\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{R})$. 
    Let $X \subseteq \mathcal{V}$ such that for any $x \in X$, 
    $x \in \mathcal{R}(x)$. Let $\varphi$ be a boolean combination of
    events in $M$. If $X=x$ is an actual cause of $\varphi$, then $X$
    is a singleton.
\end{theorem}

Given Thm. \ref{th:singleton-cause}, condition AC3 can be verified
in constant time.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring
    {Restricted Search Space for $Z$}
    {Restricte Search Space for \textit{Z}}
}

The following theorem is presented by Hopkins
\cite{hopkins2002strategies} as a result of a theorem by Eiter and 
Lukasiewicz \cite{eiter2001complexity}:

\begin{theorem}\label{th:restricted-Z}
    Let $M$ be a binary causal model. Suppose for a given $x,y,w$, 
    conditions AC1, AC2.a, and AC2.b hold. Then AC2.c holds if and 
    if for $Z=V \setminus (X \cup W)$:
    $$ (M, u) \models [X=x, W=w, Z=z] (Y=y) $$. 
\end{theorem}

Given Thm. \ref{th:singleton-cause}, \ref{th:restricted-Z}, deciding 
an instance of the causality problem is NP-complete.
