\section{Introduction}

\begin{example}
\label{example:loop}
We use an example through the paper to illustrate 
the concepts.
Consider the network depicted in figure \ref{fig:loop}.
In this network, we have four switches and solid arrows show 
the initial routes.
Assume that two concurrent updates $p,q$ will happen in the network.
The update $p$ replaces the route $cd$ with $cbd$ and 
$q$ replaces the route $abc$ with $ac$.
Assume that we require to ensure that no loop appears in the network at 
any given time.
If $q$ happens before $p$ then we have loop in network between the $b$ 
and $c$.
But if $q$ happens after $p$ no loop appears in the network and we reach
the desired state without violating the loop-freedom property.
In the following, we explain how we can use the causal model to show that the 
lack of ordering between $p$ and $q$ is an actual cause of 
the loop-freedom violation.
