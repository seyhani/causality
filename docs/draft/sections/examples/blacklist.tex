\begin{example}

Consider the network in the figure \ref{fig:blacklist}.
Assume that two updates, $p$ and $q$ happening in the network.
$p$ replaces the path $ab$ with $ac$ and $q$ replaces
the path $cb$ with $cd$.
We use the event structure shown in \ref{fig:blacklist:es}
to model this network.
We use $p_1,p_2,q_1,q_2$ for the update and 
$ad_1,ad_2$ for the event of forwarding a packet from $a$
to $d$.
For simplicity, we do not consider forwarding events 
other than $ad$.
Using our causal mode, we can prove that lack of conflict
between $p_1$ and $q_1$ is an actual cause of 
$\s{p_1,q_1,ad_1}$ being a configuration of the event structure.
